# Hacktoberfest Speedrun

Hi there! Welcome to this repository which explains how to speedrun Hacktoberfest!

## Step 1

> **Warning**
> **YOU DON'T**. 
>
> Hacktoberfest isn't about racing to win a shirt (planting trees is the better option btw) - it's about making valuable contributions to the open source community. Spamming PRs, or looking for cheaty repos like this one, is incredibly against what we are trying to do. Please take the time to find legitimate projects, and make meaningful contributions.

## PR This Repo Anyway??

> **Note**
> 
> I have explicitly requested this repo be excluded from Hacktoberfest as it's CLEARLY not in line with the core values.

> **Warning**
> 
> If you choose to PR this repo anyway, your PR will auto-close **and be labelled spam**. Get 2 PRs labelled `spam` and you win an **indefinite ban** from participating in Hacktoberfest.
